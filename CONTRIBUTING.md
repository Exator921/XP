# You can make your own versions of the game using the XP.unitypackage to contribute or offer up suggestions and features for the game

**You may not make a version of the game and claim it to be yours. You did not come up with the project, you forked it from me, know the difference**

**You can not try selling a version of the game or try making the game proprietary. I made it open sorce for a reason**

**Keep the game at least Rated M, I don't want to look around and see porn versions of the game and I don't want kids/adults thinking thats what the main project is**
