# XP

This is XP. 

A game with no "real" story, no point, and really no end. It just kinda exists. I made it from playing around with Unity to see what I could do. It started as a terrain test for me to play with the terrain tool for my Game Design class then slowly became it's own little world. If you want a story it's up to you to make it, pretty much a sand box but with just a world and character.


<----- HOW TO PLAY ------>

Use WASD to move the character, use your mouse to look around, press and hold SHIFT to run while pressing a move key, and use SPACE to jump.

Press M to pause or play music. (_More music may or may not come._)

<-----HOW TO CLOSE THE GAME----->

Press ESC (_Escape_) to force quite.

<-----BEWARE THE WATER----->

You can move around a bit in the water but if you go to far you will fall in and be stuck falling in the water with no way back out. If you fall in, resart the game.

To download the game go to the pCloud share link below, once you install the zip file extract it and enjoy.
