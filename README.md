## This is XP

A game with no "real" story, no point, and really no end. It just kinda exists. I made it from playing around with Unity to see what I could do. It started as a terrain test for me to play with the terrain tool for my Game Design class then slowly became it's own little world. If you want a story it's up to you to make it, pretty much a sand box but with just a world and character.
